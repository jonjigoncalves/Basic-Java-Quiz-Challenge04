This app that i created is a simple quiz app about the basics of javascript. 

The answers should be simple enough that it should take more than the allotted time of 60secs. I also added a parameter that if a wrong asnwer is given, the timer loses 10 seconds. 

I added a couple features in order to enchance the  experience and not make it such an eye sore. 

One of those was an alert box that i took from bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/alerts/)

I also added a hover feature so that when you hovered over the ready button it would change color, i also did that for the choices. 

I attempted to display an alert that would come up if you got the answer right but i couldnt make it work without using bootstrap. i wanted to make it work with java script. I know that i could create a function that would be like checkAnswer(), and set create an alert of the questionObj.asnwer is chosen, and an else if it isnt.  but this is already late so ill work on it later. 

Cory Yates, my tutor was very helpful with setting up the timeInterval so that the clock would run down.

I also had help from professor JD with an issue where my scores were not being outputting to the html. but some debugging my showquestion and getUserscores() that if statment is all him haha

I then had an issue where my form where the user would enter their name wouldn't stay hidden with the display none i added to it. you'll see a few commented out lines of code that i tried.
